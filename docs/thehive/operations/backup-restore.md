## Cassandra

### Backup

To backup or export database from Cassandra, following information are required: 

- Cassandra admin password

- keyspace used by thehive (default = `thehive`). This can be checked in the `application.conf`configuration file, in the database configuration in *storage*, *cql* and `keyspace` attribute. 

    ```
    [..]
    db.janusgraph {
      storage {
        backend: cql
        hostname: ["127.0.0.1"]
    
        cql {
          cluster-name: thp
          keyspace: thehive
        }
      }
    [..]
    ```

    

Considering that your keyspace is `thehive` and `backup_name` is the name of the snapshot, run the following commands:

- Before taking snapshots

```bash
nodetool cleanup thehive
```

- Take a snapshot
- 
```bash
nodetool snapshot thehive -t backup_name
```

- Create and archive with the snapshot data: 

```bash
tar cjf backup.tbz /var/lib/cassandra/data/thehive/*/snapshots/backup_name/
```

- Remove old snapshots

```bash
nodetool -h localhost -p 7199 clearsnapshot -t <snapshotname>
```



### Restore

- Unarchive backup files: 

```bash
tar jxf /PATH/TO/backup.tbz -C /
```


- And restore snapshots files:

```bash
cd /var/lib/cassandra/data/thehive

for I in `ls /var/lib/cassandra/data/thehive`  ; do cp /var/lib/cassandra/data/thehive/$I/snapshots/backup_name/* /var/lib/cassandra/data/thehive/$I/ ; done

```

- Ensure Cassandra user keep ownership on the files: 

```bash
chown -R cassandra:cassandra /var/lib/cassandra/data/thehive
```


- Restart services

```bash
service cassandra restart
service thehive restart
```

**Note:**

- Ensure no Commitlog file exist before restarting Cassandra service. (`/var/lib/cassandra/commitlog`).
