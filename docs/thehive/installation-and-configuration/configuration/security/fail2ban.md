# Adding TheHive into Fail2Ban



Considering **TheHive** logs sits in `/var/log/thehive/application.log` and **fail2ban ** configuration is in `/etc/fail2ban`:

1. Add a filter file in `/etc/fail2ban/filter.d` named `thehive.conf` with the following content: 

    ```
    [INCLUDES]
    before = common.conf
    
    [Definition]
    failregex = ^.*- <HOST> (?:POST \/api\/login|GET .*) .*returned 401.*$
    ignoreregex =
    ```

    

2. Add a jail file in `/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/`named `thehive.local` with the following content: 

    ```
    [thehive]
    enabled = true
    port = 80,443
    filter = thehive
    action = iptables-multiport[name=thehive, port="80,443"]
    logpath = /var/log/thehive/application.log
    maxretry = 5
    bantime = 14400
    findtime = 1200
    ```

    This will ban any IP address for 4h if 5 failed authentication are identified during a period of 20 min. 

3. Reload the configuration with the command `fail2ban-client reload`

## Manage banned IP addresses

- Review banned IP addresses: 

    ```bash
    fail2ban-client status thehive
    ```

    

- Unban an IP address: 

    ```bash
    fail2ban-client set thehive unbanip <IP ADDRESS>
    ```
