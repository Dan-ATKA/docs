# Sharing

In TheHive4, you can share 3 type of objects:

- A `case`
- A `task`
- An `observable`

To share an object, you must have the `manageShare` permission (refer to [Profiles and permissions](../../Administrators/profiles/))

You can share only with `organisations` that are linked to your `organisation` (refer to [Organisations, Users and sharing](../../organisation-managers/organisations-users-sharing/))

## Share a case

You can share your `case` by clicking the *Sharing* button in the `case` *Action ribbon*

When you share a `case`, you have to chose:

- To which `organisation(s)`
- To which `profile`
- To share `tasks` or not
- To share `observables` or not

## Share a task

You can share a `task` (the `case` have to be shared too for this functionnality to be available)

At the very bottom of a *Task page* (*Case > Observables > Observables*), in the section *Task sharing*, clic on *Add share*

![add share task button](../images/add-share-task.png)

Then you can select to which `organisation` you will share the `task`:

You can share an `observable` (the `case` have to be shared too for this functionnality to be available)

At the very bottom of a *Observable page* (*Case > Observables > Observable*), in the section *Sharing*, clic on *Add share*

![add share button](../images/add-share-task.png)

Then you can select to which `organisation` you will share the `observable`:

## Delete a share

You can cancel the share of an object. 

For each object type, go to the *Share list* and trigger the *Delete* button in the *Actions* column:
