# Close a case

Closing a `case` is one of the basic TheHive functionnalities. It indicates the investigations and responses on this incident are over.

To close a `case`, you must have the `manageCase` permission (refer to [Profiles and permissions](../../Administrators/profiles/))

You can find the Close button on the `case` banner:

Closing a `case` requires that all `tasks` contained in the `case` are closed. If you didn't closed the `tasks` before, a pop-up will suggest you to close them all.

Finally, provide the necessary details to close the case:

- Status: If the `case` was a *True Positive*, a *False Positive*, if this is still *Indeterminate* or *Other* (not an incident)
    - If True positive: Was there an impact (yes/no)
- Summary: a summary of the incident
